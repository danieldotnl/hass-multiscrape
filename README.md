# HA MultiScrape custom component
This Home Assistant custom component can scrape multiple fields (using CSS selectors) from a single HTTP request (the existing scrape sensor can scrape a single field only). The scraped data becomes available in separate sensors.

It is based on both the existing [Rest sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest/) and the [Scrape sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/scrape). Most properties of the Rest and Scrape sensor apply.
